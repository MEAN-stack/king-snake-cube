# king-snake-cube
Haskell demo

The king snake cube is a wooden puzzle comprising 64 small wooden cubes joined on an elastic thread.
Some cubes are threaded 'straight through' and some 'right-angled'.
The result is that the cubes can be flattened out to look like a snake, or can be convolved into various shapes in three dimensions.

The challenge - which, without the aid of a computer, is considerable, is to wind the snake into a 4x4x4 cube.
